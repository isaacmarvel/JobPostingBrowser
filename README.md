# JobPostingBrowser

## Dependencies

- Quasar; can be installed with: `npm i -g @quasar/cli`

## Running
You will need a 3rd party API key for the Reed job postings that I'm pulling. This will need to be added in a launchSettings.Jjson file as an environmentVariable (under "profiles"), in a Properties folder in JobPostingBrowser.Api.

For the api:
Run JobPostingBrowser.Api in Visual studio or with "dotnet run" in the command line.

For the web app:
In a separate command line window, navigate to JobPostingBrowser.App and start the app with "quasar dev".
